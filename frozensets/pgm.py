# Python frozenset
# frozenset is an immutable version of a set.

# Like sets, it contains unique, unordered, unchangeable elements.

# Unlike sets, elements cannot be added or removed from a frozenset.

# Creating a frozenset
# Use the frozenset() constructor to create a frozenset from any iterable.

x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})
print(x)
print(type(x))
