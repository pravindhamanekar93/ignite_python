🧠 PART 1: 30 IMPORTANT CONCEPT QUESTIONS (WITH ANSWERS)
1️⃣ What is the difference between list and tuple?

👉 List is mutable, tuple is immutable.

2️⃣ Are strings mutable?

👉 No, strings are immutable.

💻 Hands-on coding

No MCQ. Direct Q → Answer.

🔥 SECTION 1: CONCEPTUAL + TRICKY (1–25)
1️⃣ What is the difference between list and tuple?

Answer: List is mutable, tuple is immutable.

2️⃣ Why are strings immutable?

Answer: For memory optimization, security, and hashability.

3️⃣ What does id() return?

Answer: Memory address of object.

4️⃣ What is the output?
a = [1,2,3]
b = a
b.append(4)
print(a)


Answer: [1,2,3,4] (same reference)

5️⃣ What is shallow copy?

Answer: Copy of object but nested objects still share memory.

6️⃣ What is deep copy?

Answer: Completely independent copy.
